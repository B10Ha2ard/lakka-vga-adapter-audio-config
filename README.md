# lakka-vga-adapter-audio-config
Basic scripts to enable and disable audio jack when using a VGA adapter with Lakka installed on a Raspberry Pi.

Copy the scripts to the home folder on the Lakka device and set the permissions to allow for execution.

First run the installation script to append the path of the additional configuration file to the main Raspberry Pi configuration file.

Then run the enable script to enable the audio jack when using a VGA adapter with Lakka on the Raspberry Pi.

If you want to use the Raspberry Pi with an HDMI television or screen again run the disable script.
